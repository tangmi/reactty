# reactty

have **YOU** ever wanted to make a cli app that looks and feels kinda maybe like a desktop or webapp? have you had to settle for spamming `console.log`s like a peasant? have **I** got a thing for **YOU**!

introducing (for the first time ever) reactive mustache-like templating for TTY!!!

just follow the steps:

1. create a template (any mustache template will do, i'm using [`handlebars`](http://handlebarsjs.com/) under the hood)
2. create a view with that template
3. just update the context object and...
4. voil√†, shit just rendered the change itself!

# usage

```
npm install reactty
```

for now, check out `./test/basic.js` for features

things to node:

* if the output is too big, scroll around with the arrow keys (issue #2)
* the display seen when resizing the window is a little bit broken (due to how node triggers its resize event, it will always be one step late)

```js
var reactty = require('reactty');

/*
 * new reactty.View(TEMPLATE_SOURCE_STRING[, optionalInitalContext])
 *
 * Create a view that will clear and replace stdout with your template.
 * Any updates to the view's data will immediately reflect in the
 * rendered text, without needs for manually notifying the view of
 * changes. Neato!
 *
 * It'll throw an error if the terminal running the program does not
 * support TTY, and will tell you to fallback to peasant logging schemes
 * for output.
 */
var view = new reactty.View('Hi, my name is {{name}}');

// update the context and the view will update accordingly
setTimeout(function() {
	view.data.name = 'tangmi';
}, 1000);

```
